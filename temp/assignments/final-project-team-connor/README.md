Demo Time: Thursday, June 11 at 11am

This is a mock of what the OSU Men's Club Lacrosse Team's website could look like. We have a home page in addtion to pages for 
the schedule, roster, and a way to get involved. The schedule page has three made up games as the end of this season was cancelled
due to obvious current events. The user can type in the name of a team and that game will be added to their google calendar. The roster contains information about the team including height/weight, hometown, and high school. This content is all served dynamically from the players.json file. The contact us page allows for the user to  send us their name and email so we could add them to a non-existent mailing list. There is also information about any upcoming events on this page. These events are also made up due to current events. 

We obtained some of our content from the following sources:
