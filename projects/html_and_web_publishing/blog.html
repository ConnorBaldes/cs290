            I did not have have many troubles completing this assignments, I have not yet posted it to the internet
            so I may still experience issues with that but so far so good. I came into the class with a strong base understanding
            of HTML so to assignment was a good refresher on infprmation I already knew. The resource that I used the most for this 
            assignmet was the class notes. I used the notes to help me set up my html file along with making sure my syntac was correct. 
            Thank you for coming to my ted talk, stay classy San Diego.
