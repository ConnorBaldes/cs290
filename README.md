# CS291: Web Development

CS291 introduces the fundamental technologies and concepts behind modern web development. This course covers both **client-side** and **server-side** development, focusing on creating interactive, scalable, and maintainable web applications. The projects in this repository provide hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and database interactions.

## Key Topics
- **HTML & CSS**: Structuring and styling web pages.
- **Client-Side JavaScript**: Enhancing interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Node.js & Express**: Building server-side logic and APIs.
- **Templating Engines**: Rendering dynamic content with Handlebars.
- **Database Interaction**: Storing and retrieving data with MongoDB.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling API requests and server communication.
- **Security & Authentication**: Protecting user data and preventing vulnerabilities.
- **Version Control**: Managing code efficiently using Git and GitHub.

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, one will be able to:
- Develop standards-compliant static web pages using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Implement interactive client-side behaviors with **JavaScript**.
- Utilize **asynchronous calls** to send and receive data between client and server.
- Create dynamic, server-rendered web applications using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- Design and integrate **MongoDB** for persistent data storage.
